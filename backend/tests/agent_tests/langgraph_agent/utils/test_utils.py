"""Layer 1 — `agents/langgraph_agent/utils/utils.py`.

Pure functions, no mocking, no I/O. `build_filter_string()` turns a `FilterArgs` model
into a Typesense `filter_by` expression, so its output is a wire format: if it is wrong,
`SemanticFilterSearch` silently returns nothing rather than raising. That makes it worth
pinning precisely.

Two real defects are pinned below with `xfail(strict=True)` — the tests describe the
*intended* behaviour and will flip to a failure (XPASS) the moment the bug is fixed,
which is the signal to delete the marker. See the module docstring of each for detail.
